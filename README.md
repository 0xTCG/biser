# BISER

BISER (Brisk Inference of Segmental duplication Evolutionary stRucture) is a fast tool for detecting and decomposing segmental duplications in genome assemblies.


## Instalation

BISER requires [Seq programming language](https://docs.seq-lang.org/intro.html#install) 
and Python 3.7+ to run.

To install BISER, install Seq and then run:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/0xTCG/biser.git
```

## Usage
### Single genome

To find SDs in a single genome, just run:
```bash
biser -o <output> -t <threads> <genome.fa> 
```

BISER will also produce `output.elem.txt` file that contains the elementary SD
decomposition of the final SD set.

All genomes should be indexed beforehand with `samtools faidx genome.fa`.

> **WARNING!** Genomes *must* be hard-masked. This requirement will be lifted in the 
> next release of BISER.

### Multiple genomes

To find SDs in multiple genomes, just run:
```bash
biser -o <output> -j <jobs> <genome1.fa> <genome2.fa> ...
```

## Paper & Simulations

BISER was published in WABI 2021 proceedings and [is available here](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2021/14368/pdf/LIPIcs-WABI-2021-15.pdf).

Paper simulations are available in [scripts](scripts/) and [simulation](simulation/)
directories.

> We will provide more experimental details soon.
